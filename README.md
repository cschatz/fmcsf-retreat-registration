# FMCSF Retreat Registration Scripts

This repo represents the overall registration web and interface management system for FMCSF's annual Fall Retreat, built with Google's [Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) framework. 
As attendees submit registration information on the site/form, inputs are validated and feedback given.
Upon submission, the app generates a confirmation email and populates a Google spreadsheet for the registration
manager to use in room assignment, billing, etc.

This project actually exists and is maintained on my Google account. 

For read-only access to a folder holding the core scripts and a small subset of registration data (with names replaced by pseudonyms), go here:

This system is still the basis for the public-facing retreat registration process. The instance of the live form that is active for the current year is here:
