<h1>FMCSF Retreat 20__ Registration</h1>

<p>Welcome to the online registration for the FMCSF Fall Retreat, held September 6-8, 2019 at Redwood Glen, a retreat
center in the Santa Cruz mountains near the town of Pescadero. See <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fFmHF" target="_blank">this map</a>
for the specific location and directions. </p>

<p>Please go through each part of this carefully. We know there are many questions and pieces of information,
but it is all important and helps us create a successful retreat experience for everyone.</p>

<!-- <p>
If there are any questions or concerns
that arise during the registration process, please contact .....
</p> -->

<hr />

<h2>Announcements for 2019</h2>

<p>Please be aware of the following changes:</p>

<ol>


<li>All performers at the open mic are asked to limit themselves to a single appearance. Everyone is invited to bring
further offerings to the campfire.

<li>Jennifer will bring the older kids to Bean Hollow State Beach on Saturday at 10am and stay there for lunch. If you or 
your child will be going to the beach on Saturday please <b>do not</b> register them for lunch. Lunch arrangements will be 
made separately with kids/adults going to the beach.  Please meet at the ping-pong table outside Siden Center with sunblock on, 
and toys, frisbees, towels and snacks in hand.

<li>Once again, we will <b>not</b> have breakfast in the Redwood Glen dining hall on Saturday morning. Instead,
there will breakfast provided and prepared by us (Retreat Committee and other FMCSF people) <b>downstairs in Siden</b>
that morning. (The Sunday morning breakfast option remains the same as previous years.)

<li>Like last year, our shared-accomodations option will be <b>Retreat Lodge</b>, a smaller building than our previous Shepherd Lodge, 
that is somewhat closer to Siden. See 
<a href="https://www.redwoodglen.com/facilities/camp-facilities/retreat-lodge" target="_blank">Retreat Lodge</a> for more information.

<h2>Costs and Lodging Options</h2>

<p>We know retreat can be an expensive event, and that members of our community approach it from different financial and logistical contexts.
Please be aware:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><u>Everyone</u> is welcome and encouraged to attend retreat and pay what you can.</b>
<li>Those who are able are invited to pay an amount above cost. This helps subsidize the retreat experience overall
 and pay the cost of hosting our MVS volunteers.
</ul>

<p><strong><u>Overnight Accommodations</u></strong></p>

<p>The three options for overnight accommodations are explained below, with prices shown at cost.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Siden Center</b>
<ul>
<li>Each room has 2 double beds and a private bathroom. These rooms are similar to hotel
 rooms and include towels, sheets, pillows and soap.
<li><b>$139 per night</b> for double occupancy ($69.50 per person per night).
<li><u>No extra charge for children staying in a Siden room with parents.</u> However, Redwood Glen does charge us $20 for each rollaway we request.
</ul>
<li><b>Retreat Lodge</b>
<ul>
<li>Shared sleeping rooms with bunk beds, and shared bathrooms. (There is more info about Retreat Lodge <a href="https://www.redwoodglen.com/facilities/camp-facilities/retreat-lodge" target="_blank">here</a>.)
<li>Bedding, pillows, towels and soap are NOT PROVIDED.
<li><b>$38 per person per night</b>
</ul>
<li><b>Camping</b>
<ul>
<li>There are limited campsites above the playground area. No facilities are provided at the campsites, 
but bathrooms/showers are available in the shared pool area.
<li><b>$12.50 per person per night</b>
</ul>

</ol>

<p><strong><u>Meals</u></strong></p>

<p><b><i>All children under 13 eat for free.</i></b>
Otherwise, prices for meals are:

<ul>
<li>Friday dinner: <b>FREE</b>
<li>Saturday breakfast: <b>$5.00 per person</b> (age 13 and up)
<li>Saturday lunch: <b>$13.59 per person</b> (age 13 and up)

<h2>Saturday Breakfast</h2>

<p>Like last year, Retreat Committee and volunteers will prepare breakfast on Saturday morning

<p>If you signed up for Saturday breakfast above, please let us know what type of breakfast food you
would be interested in:<br />
(For instance: eggs/toast, fruit/yoghurt/granola, muffin/scone, smoothie... something else?)</p>

<h2>Pets, Drugs and Alcohol</h2>

<p>As part of our contract with Redwood Glen, we agree to the same policies that apply to all groups who use their facilities. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Guests may not bring pets to Redwood Glen (except Guide Dogs).
<li>No alcohol or illegal drugs may be used at Redwood Glen. 
</ul>

<p>Beyond these official policies, as members of our own shared community, 
we expect everyone to contribute to making the retreat a comfortable and safe environment for all who attend.</p>

<h2>Transportation</h2>

<p>In order to facilitate everyone's participation in retreat, Retreat Committee will organize the matching of drivers and riders for carpooling purposes.</p>

<p><u>Special note to SF car owners:</u> We always have a particularly strong need for drivers from San Francisco.
Even if folks don't know their plans or would be willing to serve as backup and not as a primary driver it would really help to
know as there are always last minute needs/changes that need work arounds.</p>

<p><b>Select any item(s) below that apply.</b></p>

<p>
<input type="checkbox" id="ride_needed" name="ride_needed" value="yes" />
