# fmcsf-retreat-registration

This repo represents the overall registration web and interface management system for FMCSF's annual Fall Retreat. 
As attendees submit registration information on the site/form, inputs are validated and feedback given.
Upon submission, the app generates a confirmation email and populates a Google spreadsheet for the registration
manager to use in room assignment, billing, etc.

This project actually exists and is maintained on my Google account. 
It currently includes a couple Google apps acripts and one Google spreadsheet document.

For read-only access to the folder holding these, go here:

[RetreatScript folder](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f9VqUxaZP9PuWN_0Pa-PFOgqNGi5KaWyEaxAXQCd1oQ/edit?usp=sharing)

[To look at the scripts online with Google's script interface, you will need to make sure
the Google Apps Script app is connected to your Drive account: Settings -> Manage Apps -> Connect more apps.]
